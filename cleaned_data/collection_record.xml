    <abstract>This digital collection contains transcripts of speeches given by Howard Baker during his tenure in the U.S. Senate. The topics include politics, trade, international relations, energy, the economy, and the environment. Born and raised in East Tennessee, Howard H. Baker, Jr. served three terms as a United States Senator from Tennessee (1967-1985) and was the state's first Republican senator. Baker rose to national prominence during the Watergate hearings of 1973-1974 as vice chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee. He served as minority leader of the Senate from 1977-1981, and as majority leader from 1981 until his retirement from the Senate at the end of his third term in 1985. He was a candidate for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination and was President Reagan's chief of staff in 1987-1988. He served as United States Ambassador to Japan from 2001 to 2005. Because of his reputation of civility and ability to work well with members of all parties, he is remembered as “The Great Conciliator”.</abstract>
